Students were asked to report information relating to their academics. This includes information such as what college they were currently enrolled in, their class standing, major, GPA, and enrolled units. They were also asked questions about programs they participate in as well as what type of students they identify as (transfer, international, etc.). 

*As a reminder, students had the option to select "Prefer not to answer" for all questions, and these responses were set as missing values. In addition, `r get_count_and_percent(bns$finished, 'FALSE')` students did not finish the survey. The n reporting refers to the total number of non-missing responses, while the percent reporting reflects the percent of non-missing responses.*



## Academic Level

```{r}
#| fig-height: 4.5
#| fig-width: 5.5
#| fig-cap: !expr sprintf("%s Student Academic Level %s.", NextFigure(), print_n_reporting('q15'))
bns$q15 <- recode(bns$q15,
              "Freshman (0-29 semester units or 0-44 quarter units)" = "Freshman",
              "Sophomore (30-59 semester units or 45-89 quarter units)" = "Sophomore",
              "Junior (60-89 semester units or 90-134 quarter units)" = "Junior",

**Survey Question: ** *Estimate your class standing by units completed (do not include units from this semester/quarter):*

**Summary: ** Of the `r sum(table(bns$q15))` students reporting, `r get_count_and_percent(bns$q15, "Freshman")` were freshmen, `r get_count_and_percent(bns$q15, "Sophomore")` were sophomores, `r get_count_and_percent(bns$q15, "Junior")` were juniors, and `r get_count_and_percent(bns$q15, "Senior")` were seniors.

## Major

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 8.5
#| fig-cap: !expr sprintf("%s Academic Majors %s.", NextFigure(), print_n_reporting('q16'))
bns <- bns %>% mutate(q16=recode(q16, 
                                 "Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) (Includes Medicine, Computer Science, Agriculture, Accounting, Statistics, Nursing, and Nutrition)" = "Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM)"))

plot_frq(bns$q16, geom.colors = plot_color, ylim=c(0, 1.3*max(table(bns$q16))), wrap.labels = 16, sort.frq = 'desc') + xlab('') + ylab("Number of Students") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10))

```

**Survey Question: ** *Which of the following categories best describes your major?*

**Additional Notes: ** Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) was shortened for the figure above, but also includes the following majors: Medicine, Computer Science, Agriculture, Accounting, Statistics, Nursing, and Nutrition.


**Summary: ** A total of `r count_and_percent(bns$q16, "Public Health, Social Services, Social Science, and Education")` students were majoring in a Public Health, Social Services, Social Science, or Education, while `r count_and_percent(bns$q16, "Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM)")` students majored in STEM.

## Overall GPA

```{r}
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 5.5
#| fig-cap: !expr sprintf("%s Reported GPA %s.", NextFigure(), print_n_reporting('q17'))
bns$gpa_fac <- cut(bns$q17, breaks = c(0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 5.0), labels = c("1.5 or less", "1.51-2.0", "2.01-2.5", "2.51-3.0", "3.01-3.5", "3.51 or above"), ordered_result = TRUE, include.lowest = TRUE)

plot_frq(bns$gpa_fac, geom.colors = plot_color) + xlab('GPA') + ylab("Number of Students") + ylim(0, 1.3*max(table(bns$gpa_fac)))
```

**Survey Question: ** *What is your approximate overall grade point average (GPA)? Remember that your GPA is on a scale from 0 to 4.0.*


**Summary: ** The average overall GPA for students was `r round(mean(bns$q17, na.rm = TRUE), 2)`, while the median was `r round(median(bns$q17, na.rm = TRUE), 2)`. A total of `r get_count_and_percent3(bns$q17, 3)` students had a GPA greater than or equal to 3.0, and `r get_count_and_percent3(bns$q17, 3.7)` had a GPA greater than or equal to 3.7.

## Currently Enrolled Units

```{r}
#| fig-height: 3.4
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-cap: !expr sprintf("%s Enrolled Units %s.", NextFigure(), print_n_reporting('q18'))
bns$q18 <- round(bns$q18, 0) # Rounded non-integers to integers
bns$full_time <- ifelse(bns$q18 >= 12, "Yes", "No")

plot_frq(bns$units_binned, geom.colors = plot_color) + xlab('Units') + ylab("Number of Students") + ylim(0, 1.3*max(table(bns$units_binned)))
```

**Survey Question: ** *How many units are you currently taking?*

**Summary: ** Students were enrolled in an average of `r round(mean(bns$q18, na.rm = TRUE), 2)` units, while the median was `r median(bns$q18, na.rm = TRUE)`. A total of `r get_count_and_percent(bns$full_time, "Yes")` students were considered full-time (12 or more units), with `r names(sort(table(bns$q18), decreasing=TRUE)[1])` units being the most common response and `r names(sort(table(bns$q18), decreasing=TRUE)[2])` units being the second most common.

## I identify as...

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: !expr sprintf("%s Academic Identifiers.", NextTable())

binary_table(questions, "Yes", rnames, ".", col.title = "Student Identifiers:")
```

**Survey Question:** *Please check any statement below that you identify with.*

**Additional Notes:** Students selected from the following options: "Yes," "No," and "I don't know." Responses of "I don't Know" were set as missing values. The n count next to each label represents the total number of non-missing responses. 

**Summary:** A total of `r count_and_percent(bns$q14_1, "Yes")` of students identified as transfer students, `r count_and_percent(bns$q14_8, "Yes")` identified as students with English as their second language, and `r count_and_percent(bns$q14_2, "Yes")` identified as LGBTQA+.
