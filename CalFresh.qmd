Students were asked to report information relating to the CalFresh Food Program and CalFresh Food eligibility. This includes U.S. citizenship (or lawful permanent residency), household size, and monthly household income. Those that were not using CalFresh Food were asked to report any barriers to applying for CalFresh Food, while those that reported currently using CalFresh Food were asked to report their monthly Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT), whether the EBT received is enough for them, and their perceived impact of CalFresh Food. 

*Note: EBT is the CalFresh benefits delivery system that holds CalFresh dollars similar to a debit card. The California CalFresh Food Program is known federally as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).*

*As a reminder, students had the option to select "Prefer not to answer" for all questions, and these responses were set as missing values. In addition, `r get_count_and_percent(bns$finished, 'FALSE')` students did not finish the survey. The n reporting refers to the total number of non-missing responses, while the percent reporting reflects the percent of non-missing responses.*

**Survey Questions:**

-   *How many people in your household do you purchase and prepare food with, including yourself? This may or may not include your roommate(s).*

-   *Based on the household you defined in the previous question, how much is your household's gross monthly income (before taxes and not including financial aid)? Note: Monthly income is money earned from jobs on your pay stubs, paid internships, or money deposited in your accounts every month from others (like parents). If you are not sure about your gross income, take your hourly rate and multiply by the number of hours you work per month. Please do NOT include financial aid or grants. Please do NOT include one-time monetary gifts from family or friends. Please do NOT include any balance in personal savings accounts. Remember, if you have a household of more than 1, you must include everyone's gross income (use your best guess).*

**Additional Notes:** Household size and income are used to determine CalFresh Food eligibility (among other factors). Cells highlighted in green indicate a student is likely eligible for CalFresh Food based on their self-reported income/household size, and cells highlighted in red indicate a student is likely ineligible. Household size was asked in a multiple choice format with options ranging from *"1 (myself)"* to *"8 or more (myself plus 7, etc.),"* where those who reported eight or more were coded as *"8."* Hence, there was some uncertainty in determining eligibility among students who reported a household size of eight or more and a higher income, where these cells are highlighted in yellow.

**Summary:** The most common household size reported was a household size of `r names(sort(table(bns$household_size), decreasing=TRUE)[1])`, while the most common income reported was `r names(sort(table(bns$monthly_hh_income), decreasing=TRUE)[1])`. A total of `r table(bns$monthly_hh_income, bns$household_size)[1,1]` students who had a household size of one with a monthly household income of less than \$150, and `r table(bns$monthly_hh_income, bns$household_size)[2,1]` students who had a household size of one with a monthly household income of \$151-\$2,148 were deemed likely eligible for CalFresh Food. Of those with a household size of one, `r round(100*(table(bns$monthly_hh_income, bns$household_size)[1,1] + table(bns$monthly_hh_income, bns$household_size)[2,1]) / NROW(for_reporting_hs1), 1)`% met the income/household size eligibility criteria. Of those with a household size of two, `r round(100*(table(bns$monthly_hh_income, bns$household_size)[1,2] + table(bns$monthly_hh_income, bns$household_size)[2,2] + table(bns$monthly_hh_income, bns$household_size)[3,2]) / NROW(for_reporting_hs2), 1)`% met the income/household size eligibility criteria.

**Survey Questions:** *This variable was derived using self-reported household size and income (See [Income & Household Size](#reference1))*

**Additional Notes:** Only county workers have the authority to determine official eligibility for CalFresh Food. These eligibility rates were estimated based on self-reported household size and income. Below is a list of eligibility criteria for students:

-   Meets household size/income requirements from the California Department of Social Services.
-   The person is either a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.\
-   If the person is between the ages of 18 to 49, and is at least a part-time student (enrolled in six or more units), then this person is classified as a student by the California Department of Social Services and needs to meet the following additional criteria:
    -   Does not get more than half of their meals from meal plans (less than 11 per week). **(All students from this study met this criterion as this was one of the inclusion criteria to take the survey)**
    -   Meets one of the possible work requirements such as working 20 or more hours per week or being enrolled in an approved Local Program that Increases Employability (LPIE). At the time of the start of this survey, all EOP/EOPS programs were considered an LIPE, however, campuses now need to apply and receive approval for their program to be considered an LPIE. **When determining eligibility, all students were assumed to meet the work requirement since they were all EOP/EOPS students.**

**Summary:** A total of `r get_count_and_percent(bns$calfresh_eligible, "1")` students were likely eligible for CalFresh Food, while `r get_count_and_percent(bns$calfresh_eligible, "0")` were likely not eligible. Many students selected "Prefer not to answer" when reporting their income. CalFresh Food eligibility was unable to be determined among these students and among any students who answered "Prefer not to answer" to household size.

**Survey Questions:**

-   *Are you a U.S. citizen?*
-   *If not a U.S. citizen, are you a lawful permanent resident (i.e. have a "green card)?*
-   *Estimate the number of hours you work in a PAID job (e.g. server at a restaurant, office assistant, etc.) or paid internship (e.g. training, shadowing, or practicum) per week.*
-   *For income and household size survey questions, see [Income and Household Size](#reference1)*

**Additional Notes:** There are many other possible work exemptions for students to be eligible for CalFresh Food, where only the 20 hours/week work exemption was assessed in this survey. 

**Summary:** Based on self-reported data, `r get_count_and_percent(bns$citizenship, "Yes")` students met the citizenship requirement of either being a US Citizen or a lawful permanent resident. A total of `r get_count_and_percent(bns$income_eligible, "Yes")` students met the income/household size requirements, and `r get_count_and_percent(bns$work_eligible, "Yes")` students met the 20 hours/week work exemption. As a reminder, students don't need to meet a work requirement if they are enrolled in an LPIE such as an approved EOP/EOPS.

# Impact:

Only students who reported currently using CalFresh Food or used it in the past as a college student saw the following set of questions. Students were asked to report how much EBT they received per month, how many people they fed with their EBT, whether they received enough money, how long their EBT lasts every month, and their perceived impact of CalFresh Food on academic and non-academic matters.

**Survey Question:** *How much money is added to your CalFresh EBT card each month for your CalFresh household (i.e. the people you purchase and prepare food with)?*

**Summary:** The average amount of money received per household using CalFresh Food (denoted by the dotted line) was \$`r round(mean(bns$q49_1, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, while the median was \$`r round(median(bns$q49_1, na.rm=TRUE),2)`.

**Survey Questions:**

-   *For the number of people fed through EBT, see [CalFresh Food EBT](#reference2)*
-   *For the amount of EBT received per month, see [Monthly CalFresh Food Money](#reference3)*

**Additional Notes:** The per person average was computed by dividing the average amount of EBT received per month by the number of people fed through EBT. Please note, there were no students who reported feeding 6 or 7 people with their EBT and these rows were omitted. 

**Summary:** The average monthly EBT received per person was `r names(table(tmp$HH.avg)[7])` for households feeding just themselves with EBT, `r names(table(tmp$HH.avg)[6])` for households feeding themselves plus one other, and `r names(table(tmp$HH.avg)[5])` for households feeding themselves plus two others. In general, as the number of people fed through EBT increases, the per person average decreases. Taking into account all households, the total per person average was: `r tmp2[7,3]`
