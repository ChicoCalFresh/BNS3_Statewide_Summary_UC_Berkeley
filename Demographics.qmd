Students were asked to report information relating to their personal demographics such as age, gender identity, race/ethnicity, number of dependents (if any), and their parents' education level. 

*As a reminder, students had the option to select "Prefer not to answer" for all questions, and these responses were set as missing values. In addition, `r get_count_and_percent(bns$finished, 'FALSE')` students did not finish the survey. The n reporting refers to the total number of non-missing responses, while the percent reporting reflects the percent of non-missing responses.*


## Age


```{r}
#| fig-cap: !expr sprintf("%s Reported Age %s.", NextFigure(), print_n_reporting('age'))  
gghistogram(bns, x = "age", add = "mean", alpha = 1, 
            fill = plot_color) + 
  xlab("Age (years)") + ylab("Number of Students")
```

**Survey Question: ** *What is your date of birth?*

**Additional Notes: ** Student age was determined by the difference between birth date and the time in which the survey was completed. Values were rounded down to the nearest whole number. 

**Summary: ** The average age of the students was `r round(mean(bns$age, na.rm = TRUE),1)` years with a range of `r min(bns$age, na.rm = TRUE)` to `r max(bns$age, na.rm = TRUE)`, and a median age of `r median(bns$age)`. A total of `r get_count_and_percent3(bns$age, 21)` students were 21 or older, and `r get_count_and_percent3(bns$age, 30)` students were 30 or older.

**Survey question: ** *What is your gender identity?*

**Summary: ** A total of `r get_count_and_percent(bns$q7, 'Woman')` students identified as a woman, `r get_count_and_percent(bns$q7, 'Man')` identified as a man, `r get_count_and_percent(bns$q7, 'Gender non-binary')` identified as gender non-binary, and `r get_count_and_percent(bns$q7, 'Gender Queer or Gender-Nonconforming')` identified as queer/non-conforming.

**Additional Notes: ** Possible answers were pulled from the U.S. Census questionnaire assessing Hispanic Origin: *Mexican; Mexican American; Chicano; Puerto Rican; Cuban; another Hispanic/Latino/Spanish origin; or not of Hispanic/Latino/Spanish origin.* 

**Summary: ** A total of `r get_count_and_percent(tmp$hispanic, 'Hispanic')` students self-identified as having Hispanic Origins and `r get_count_and_percent(tmp$hispanic, 'Non-Hispanic')` students self-identified as Non-Hispanic.

**Survey Question: ** *What race do you identify as? (Select all that apply)*

**Additional Notes: ** Possible answers were pulled from the U.S. Census questionnaire assessing race: *White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Chinese, Filipino, Asian Indian, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, Other Asian, Native Hawaiian, Samoan, Chamorro, and Other Pacific Islander.* These 14 options were collapsed into the 5 broad U.S. Census groups due to small sample sizes in some groups.

**Summary: ** A total of `r get_count_and_percent(tmp$white, '1')` students self-identified as White, `r get_count_and_percent(tmp$asian, '1')` as Asian, `r get_count_and_percent(tmp$black, '1')` as Black or African American, `r get_count_and_percent(tmp$amer_indian, '1')` as American Indian or Alaskan Native, and `r get_count_and_percent(tmp$hawaiian, '1')` as Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Additionally, `r get_count_and_percent(tmp$eth_PNTA, '1')` students preferred not to answer race, likely due to confusion between race and ethnicity.

**Survey Question: ** *If you have dependents, then how many of them receive more than 50% of their financial support from you?*


**Summary: ** Among the total sample, `r get_count_and_percent(bns$q11, "I don't have dependents")` students reported having no dependents and `r get_count_and_percent(bns$q11, "0")` reported having dependents receiving less than 50% financial support. The remaining `r count_and_percent(bns$q11, "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10")` students reported having dependents receiving more than 50% financial support. Of those with dependents receiving more than 50% financial support, `r get_count_and_percent(bns$q11_tmp, '1')` had one dependent, `r get_count_and_percent(bns$q11_tmp, '2')` had two, and `r get_count_and_percent(bns$q11_tmp, '3')` student had 3 or more dependents.

**Survey Question: ** *What is the highest level of education completed by your parents/guardians (for example, if your mother and father both raised you, and your mother has the highest level of education, then indicate her highest level of education)?*

**Additional Notes: ** This data is used to determine a student’s first-generation status. First-generation status is defined by neither parent having completed a bachelor’s degree or higher. The green bars represent first-generation categories, and the blue bars represent non-first-generation categories. Other/unknown responses are shown in gray.

**Summary: ** A total of `r get_count_and_percent(bns$firstgen, '1')` students reported first-generation status based on their parent/guardian education level. This outcome is not surprising because all students in this study were either enrolled in EOP or EOPS and both programs recruit students with first-generation status. A total of `r count_and_percent(bns$q13, "Less than high school")` students reported their parents/guardians did not complete high school, while `r count_and_percent(bns$q13, "High school diploma or GED")` reported the highest level of education completed by their parents was high school.

The `r get_count_and_percent(bns$q13, 'Other/Unknown')` students who selected "Other/Unknown" were set as missing values. All other responses were considered not first-generation.
