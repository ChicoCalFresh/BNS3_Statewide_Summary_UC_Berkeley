Students were asked to report information relating to their current and past housing conditions. This includes if they were living near their college, the type of home they were currently living in, any hardships they faced in the past year with housing, homelessness, housing insecurity, barriers to accessing housing, and any housing changes due to COVID-19.

*As a reminder, students had the option to select "Prefer not to answer" for all questions, and these responses were set as missing values. In addition, `r get_count_and_percent(bns$finished, 'FALSE')` students did not finish the survey. The n reporting refers to the total number of non-missing responses, while the percent reporting reflects the percent of non-missing responses.*

**Survey Question:** *Are you currently living in the city/area in which you are enrolled in college?*

**Summary:** A total of `r get_count_and_percent(bns$q24, "No")` students reported NOT currently living in the city/area of their college, while the remaining `r get_count_and_percent(bns$q24, "Yes")` reported currently living in the city/area of their college. While there were many students who answered "No," this could be due to many campuses offering remote classes and students choosing to live at home or in an area with a lower cost of living.

**Survey Question:** *These variables were derived from the questions in the [Past 12 Months](#In_Past_12_Months) section and from the [Sleeping Locations](#Sleeping) section.*

**Additional Notes:** 

- Housing insecurity was measured using an eight-item scale that included the six items previously used by the [Hope Lab^1^](#Footnotes), and two additional questions that were added after consultation with local stakeholders. 
    - Students who answered "Yes" to 3 or more questions from the [In Past 12 Months](#In_Past_12_Months) section were deemed housing insecure. 


- Homelessness was determined using 9 indicators of homelessness described by the [Researching Basic Needs in Higher Education Report^2^](#Footnotes). The survey questions measure indicators of homelessness in the last 30 days and 12 months based on the definitions of homelessness used by the U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Education. 
    - From the [Sleeping Locations](#Sleeping) section, students who reported sleeping in any of the following places in the past 12 months or 30 days were deemed as homeless: *"At a shelter," "Temporarily staying with a relative, friend, or couch surfing until I find other housing," "Temporarily at a hotel or motel without a permanent home to return to (not on vacation or business travel)," "In a transitional housing or independent living program," "At a group home such as halfway house or residential program for mental health or substance abuse," "Outdoor location such as street, sidewalk, alley, park, etc.," "In a car, truck, van, RV, or camper," and/or "In a closed area/space with a roof not meant for human habitation such as an abandoned building, garage, tent, etc."*

**Summary:** A total of `r get_count_and_percent(bns$housing_insecure, "1")` students were deemed as housing insecure, while `r get_count_and_percent(bns$homelessness_month, "1")` were deemed as homeless within the past month, and `r get_count_and_percent(bns$homelessness_year, "1")` were deemed as homeless within the past year of taking the survey.
