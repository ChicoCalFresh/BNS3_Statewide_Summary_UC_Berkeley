Students were screened for generalized anxiety, depression, and thoughts of suicide. Students were also asked if they had access to mental health services, as well as their experience with and barriers to mental health services on their campus. *Please note: All students were shown the following disclaimer before viewing any of the anxiety or depression screening questions and had the option to skip these entire sections:* 


**These next questions are about mental health and suicidal thoughts. Sometimes people feel so depressed about the future that they may consider attempting suicide, that is, taking some action to end their own life. These questions may be upsetting for you, and so we want to be sure that you feel comfortable continuing. Please remember that you may discontinue the survey at any time. Additionally, the following resource is available to you, should you become distressed: National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255).**


*As a reminder, students had the option to select "Prefer not to answer" for all questions, and these responses were set as missing values. In addition, `r get_count_and_percent(bns$finished, 'FALSE')` students did not finish the survey. The n reporting refers to the total number of non-missing responses, while the percent reporting reflects the percent of non-missing responses.*

**Survey Question:** [*Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by the following problems?^1^*](#Footnotes)

**Additional Notes:** These questions (from the **validated GAD-7** tool) were used to classify generalized anxiety severity (see [Generalized Anxiety Classification](#Generalized-Anxiety-Classification)).
 
 
**Summary:** Overall, the majority of students responded negatively to all options. Some highlights of the results include the following: In the past two weeks, `r count_and_percent(bns$q108_1, "Nearly every day", "More than half the days", "Several days")` students have felt nervous/anxious for several days, more than half the days, or nearly every day; `r count_and_percent(bns$q108_3, "Nearly every day", "More than half the days", "Several days")` students have worried too much about different things for several days, more than half the days, or nearly every day; and `r count_and_percent(bns$q108_4, "Nearly every day", "More than half the days", "Several days")` students have had trouble relaxing for several days, more than half the days, or nearly every day.

**Survey Question:** *This variable was created from the questions in the [Generalized Anxiety](#Generalized-Anxiety) section.*

**Additional Notes:** This variable was created using the **validated GAD-7** severity scoring. "Not at all" was scored as 0, "Several days" was scored as 1, "More than half the days" was scored as 2, and "Nearly every day" was scored as 3. Individuals' scores were added together. Those classified with "Minimal anxiety" had scores of 0-4, "Mild anxiety" had scores of 5-9, "Moderate anxiety" had scores of 10-14, and "Severe anxiety" had scores of 15-21. Anyone who answered "Prefer not to answer" to at least one of the seven questions was not classified. 


**Summary:** A total of `r get_count_and_percent(bns$GAD7, "Minimal anxiety")` students were classified as having minimal anxiety, `r get_count_and_percent(bns$GAD7, "Mild anxiety")` were classified as having mild anxiety, `r get_count_and_percent(bns$GAD7, "Moderate anxiety")` were classified as having moderate anxiety, and `r get_count_and_percent(bns$GAD7, "Severe anxiety")` were classified as having severe anxiety.

**Additional Notes:** Students who reported having thoughts that they would be better off dead or had thoughts of hurting themselves for several days, more than half the days, or nearly every day (see [Depression](#Depression) section) were shown this question.
