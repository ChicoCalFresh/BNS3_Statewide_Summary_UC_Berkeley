Note: Monthly income is money earned from jobs on your pay stubs, paid internships, or money deposited in your accounts every month from others (like parents). If you are not sure about your gross income, take your hourly rate and multiply by the number of hours you work per month. Please do NOT include financial aid or grants. Please do NOT include one-time monetary gifts from family or friends. Please do NOT include any balance in personal savings accounts. Remember, if you have a household of more than 1, you must include everyone’s gross income (use your best guess).\n\nAdditional Notes: Household size and income are used to determine CalFresh Food eligibility (among other factors). Cells highlighted in green indicate a student is likely eligible for CalFresh Food based on their self-reported income/household size, and cells highlighted in red indicate a student is likely ineligible. Household size was asked in a multiple choice format with options ranging from “1 (myself)” to “8 or more (myself plus 7, etc.),” where those who reported eight or more were coded as “8.” Hence, there was some uncertainty in determining eligibility among students who reported a household size of eight or more and a higher income, where these cells are highlighted in yellow.\nSummary: The most common household size reported was a household size of 1, while the most common income reported was $151-$2,148. A total of 30 students who had a household size of one with a monthly household income of less than $150, and 34 students who had a household size of one with a monthly household income of $151-$2,148 were deemed likely eligible for CalFresh Food. Of those with a household size of one, 85.3% met the income/household size eligibility criteria. Of those with a household size of two, 82.4% met the income/household size eligibility criteria."

At the time of the start of this survey, all EOP/EOPS programs were considered an LIPE, however, campuses now need to apply and receive approval for their program to be considered an LPIE.

Many students selected “Prefer not to answer” when reporting their income.

A total of 121 (85.2%) students met the income/household size requirements, and 31 (18.3%) students met the 20 hours/week work exemption.

Physical Activity Patterns.\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Questions: On how many of the past 7 days did you: (Please mark the appropriate column for each row)\n\nDo moderate-intensity cardio or aerobic exercise (caused a noticeable increase in heart rate, such as brisk walk) for at least 30 minutes? (n=164, 90% of 182 reporting)\nHow often did you do 8-10 strength training exercises (such as resistance weight machines) for at least 8 repetitions each? (n=166, 91% of 182 reporting)\nHow often did you do vigorous-intensity cardio or aerobic exercise (caused large increases in breathing or heart rate, such as jogging) for at least 20 minutes? (n=166, 91% of 182 reporting)\n\nAdditional Notes: For each exercise type, students had the option to select anywhere from zero days per week to seven days per week. In the table, percentages are calculated across rows.\nSummary: The majority of students reported doing moderate-intensity exercises at least once in the past seven days, and 46 (28.0%) reported doing this zero times. About half the students reported doing strength training exercises at least once in the past 7 days, and 77 (47.0%) reported doing this zero times. Less than half of the students reported doing vigorous-intensity cardio or aerobic exercises at least once in the past 7 days, and 92 (55.4%) reported doing this zero times."

Weekly Physical Activity (n=163, 90% of 182 reporting)\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Questions: See Questions Above\nAdditional Notes: This variable was created using the variables in the Physical Activity Type section. Anyone who performed any type of weekly physical activity (moderate-intensity, strength training, or vigorous-intensity) for one or more days was set to “Yes,” and anyone who performed no physical activity per week was set to “No.”\nSummary: A total of 122 (74.8%) students performed any type of physical activity at least once per week, while 41 (25.2%) performed no weekly physical activity."
